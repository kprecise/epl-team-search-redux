# EPL Team Search App V2 (React, Redux, Webpack 4, The SportsDB API, Reactstrap, SASS and Autoprefixer)
This is V2 of my EPL Team Search App. This version uses a Redux store with middleware rather local state to pass data to components

## Redux
Redux with middleware is used to record actions and dispatch relevant data to components

## Webpack (Compiled CSS with autoprefixer)
This is already configured to compile SASS to CSS and to apply autoprefixing to the CSS

## Reactstrap
Implementation of reactstrap for a responsive layout

## The SportsDB API
Integration of the SportsDB Football API. Includes a search and selection of a current English Premier League team. The result then provides details such as club location, manager, basic history etc. Under the Match History section, a user can select a particular opponent team which produces a list of dates and results between the teams.
